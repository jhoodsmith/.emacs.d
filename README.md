# My Emacs File

You find out a lot about person by the car they drive, the clothes they wear and
their `init.el` file.

I work frequently with the following languages:

- Python
- Ruby
- LaTeX
- Elixir

and configure my Emacs workflow around:

- Org mode
- Helm
- Projectile
- Tramp
- Eshell

My `init.el` is configured accordingly.

have shared their dot files on GitHub. I am indebted to all of them. If you are
one of these individuals and you notice anything in my work that blatantly still
resembles yours, then kindly get in touch and I will buy you a
beer next time you're in London.
